# Building an EXPRESS Application
## Part 1: Routes, Templates, and Views

` Create a view engine that allows me to customize at least three portions of my views using: EJS.`

`I will also create at least two different view templates for my chosen view engine. Within those views, I will include some type of navigation that allows me to swap between views. Since the default HTTP request method is "GET," this can be as simple as an anchor link that navigates to the other view's relative URL.`

`I will include a basic form in at least one view that sends a POST request to a route within my application. For now, just log that data to the console within my route and send a simple "success" response. I will nclude at least one instance of a route parameter that modifies what is rendered to the client.`
